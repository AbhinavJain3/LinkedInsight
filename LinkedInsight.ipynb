            "The founder dilemma: Should Indian startups embrace professional management?Manage SubscriptionReading ListLog Outdushyant.ips@gmail.comInvestmentsThe founder dilemma: Should Indian startups embrace professional management?Nikhil PatwardhanOctober 15, 2024 | 11 Min ReadOctober 15, 2024 | 11 Min ReadIndia’s startup ecosystem has seen many success stories, with young and ambitious founders creating disruptive businesses that upend the status quo. As these startups grow and evolve, though, a critical consideration arises—are founders best equipped to guide them through their next phase of growth?Key TakeawaysWhile founders' vision has taken major Indian startups to great heights, the need for professional management is increasingly evidentOver the years, excessive founder control has led to many startups, including Byju’s and Housing.com, facing issuesWith more startups slated to go public in coming years, various stakeholders are calling for professional management to ensure stability at startupsStartups such as Swiggy and BharatPe, among others, have bolstered their leadership with professional management and benefited from itIn 2022, foodtech major Swiggy, which was preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), brought in McKinsey alum Rohit Kapoor to lead its core food delivery business. At the time, Swiggy faced fierce competition from the newly listed Zomato, which was rapidly expanding while cutting losses. Kapoor's mission was clear: to turn around Swiggy’s food delivery operations.Two years on, even as Swiggy remains on the precipice of a public listing, Kapoor has successfully turned the company’s food delivery segment profitable. And though Swiggy on a consolidated basis is still burning cash, the profitability of its food marketplace could serve as a blueprint for the company to achieve overall profitability, which is especially crucial as its IPO now seems imminent.Kapoor has also become one of the key public faces of Swiggy, especially given how the company’s founders have historically been little-known outside of business circles.Swiggy is far from the only startup that saw merit in bringing on professional management to overcome obstacles that had proven difficult to tame. Indeed, this wasn’t even Kapoor’s first tryst with steadying a startup ship. Prior to this, he had been enlisted for a similar role at hotel aggregator OYO, which had lost control of its unit economics in its relentless quest for growth.Indeed, while professional management may not appear essential at startups, given that the founders’ vision and determination have been instrumental in major Indian startup successes such as Flipkart and Zomato, that school of thought is increasingly coming under attack.The recent spat between Ola Electric* founder and CEO Bhavish Agarwal and comedian Kunal Kamra over the former’s customer service problems re-ignited the discussion over the need for professional management. Especially since the exchange led to a ~10% fall in Ola Electric’s share price the following day.True, founders often possess a deep understanding of their products and industries, helping them build businesses from scratch. However, as companies scale, they face challenges such as managing complex operations, meeting investor expectations, and achieving sustainable growth.“While initially, high-risk investors like VCs may bet on the founder mentality, as the company becomes larger, lists on stock exchanges, and attracts other sets of investors, management has to focus on decentralising decision-making and focus on institutionalisation and sustainability of the company. There is a need for a more experienced and professional management-led approach,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of corporate governance advisory firm InGovern.To be sure, investors have often emphasised that transitioning from a startup to a larger enterprise may require a different leadership approach. Founders tend to excel in innovation, while professional managers typically bring experience in managing operational complexity, building long-term strategies, and handling stakeholder relations. Investors also view professional management as a signal of stability and maturity.Global companies such as Google and Apple have successfully navigated this transition by integrating professional leadership—such as the roles of Eric Schmidt at Google and Tim Cook at Apple—while maintaining founder influence.“At different stages, companies need different kinds of leaders or for their leaders to evolve. Uber at its inception and aggressive growth phase needed a Travis (Kalanick). There’s very little chance they would have been able to bend the rules and go against age-old regulations and taxi cartels if Travis wasn’t the CEO,” said Aakash Agrawal, Head of Digital and new age business at Anand Rathi Investment Banking.“Then after a certain point of time, as companies blitz-scale and organisations become large, depending on the company, you might need someone like a Dara (Khosrowshahi) to come in and set the house in order. Every founder has their strengths and weaknesses and it’s not about how good a founder is but what’s needed for the company at that particular stage of growth or consolidation”, said Rathi.Infographic: Sharath Ravishankar“Startups and high-growth companies, in particular, need ‘wartime’ and ‘peacetime’ CEOs—think Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. For instance, quick commerce today possibly needs a wartime CEO—a person who can be aggressive and innovate quickly amidst increasing competition,” Rathi added.The fine line between leadership and liabilityIn India, this transition can be more challenging due to concerns among founders about losing control or influence. Additionally, Indian startups are often closely tied to the founders’ personal identities, making it difficult to separate leadership from ownership.In fact, if one asks a venture capitalist why they invested in a company, especially at an early stage, the most common answer is likely, \"We believe in the founders\". The actual idea, market potential, and innovation usually come later.Founders, armed with a compelling vision, have often succeeded in attracting investors at premium valuations. Take Byju Raveendran, for example. A teacher with a humble background from a small town, he lacked the prestigious credentials of institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) or Indian Institutes of Management (IIM), yet he managed to convince global investors to back his company, valuing it as high $22 billion at one point.\"Byju’s ability to sell products and his sheer conviction were so strong that he could sell anything at a premium and people wouldn’t think twice about buying it,\" said one of the company's earliest investors, who has close ties to Raveendran.\"For years, that’s how he approached investors. When Byju was in the room pitching, he was the most convincing person there. Investors were drawn to his conviction, often buying into his story more than the numbers,\" the person added.Infographic: Sharath RavishankarBut the biggest problem with Raveendran and Byju’s, which would eventually lead to the company’s undoing, was the concentration of control he enjoyed. Despite the company growing to become the nation’s most valuable startup, it did not have professional management running the ship. Instead, Raveendran would take all major calls by himself. Consequently, the company, which is now mired in bankruptcy proceedings, witnessed high-profile boardroom drama, with its biggest shareholders attempting to oust Raveendran and his management team as they sought to rescue the spiralling company.Byju’s and other startups seem to be in trouble because the founder seemed to be making all the decisions. There is a sense of star power to the founders and even the Boards of these companies were in the dark on many decisions,” said Subramanian of InGovern.Much like Raveendran, a number of India’s startup poster boys—from Rahul Yadav of Housing.com to Ashneer Grover of BharatPe—have gone from being investor darlings to problem children. As their success grew, they often stopped heeding investor advice, which eventually contributed to their own downfall or that of their companies or both.“These are all cautionary tales. It is very difficult to get into a founder’s mindset because it keeps changing with the market situation. At times, they go behind aggressive expansion depending on many factors that are at play and, at times, they have to cut down on expenses and think about cash flow and business stability. VCs have an important role in such cases as companies evolve from one stage to another. They are akin to ‘professional management’ until the company actually gets to a stable state and has systems, processes, and personnel that ensure quality corporate governance,” said Agrawal.“While VCs are not driving, they are navigating a rapidly changing environment and if things go wrong, the navigator must also share the blame. That’s where a VC’s experience and bird’s-eye view come in handy—they have to set reasonable expectations, either aggressive or cautious, depending on incoming headwinds or tailwinds. They are the able shoulders that can help a founder be pragmatic while building a team that can bring varied skill sets and thought processes to the table. Of course, early-stage VCs need to be founder-centric but also lay down the gauntlet as the company matures to help build a more consensus-driven culture that focuses on the key stakeholders—customer, employees, and shareholders” he added.Perception mattersThe need for a more professional approach becomes even more urgent when startups list on the bourses, subjecting themselves to a higher degree of both regulatory and public scrutiny, as Ola Electric’s Aggarwal found last week. The spat, which came across as petty, had severe consequences. The drop in Ola Electric’s share price that followed saw its market capitalisation fall below $5 billion for the first time since it went public in August.A source close to Aggarwal revealed that he initially expected to gain public support, as he has in the past on several controversial issues. However, Ola Electric has faced significant criticism, particularly regarding the quality of its scooters and, more notably, its customer service. Aggarwals’ move to criticise Kamra, thus, backfired.“Bhavish has to learn to react more maturely. There have been many other instances of fights where business leaders have been involved. But those business leaders maintained decorum even when expressing their anger while justifying their case,” said Subramanian.“When one is in a customer-facing business and if the product has been ordinary, there will be service issues and customer backlash. In such cases, the founder has to have a sense of gravitas in addressing questions. Bhavish could have responded to the allegations in a more mature manner. Serious investors in the listed company do consider the behaviour of management into their investing framework and newly listed companies have to understand this,” Subramanian added.It's worth noting that Bhavish Aggarwal isn't the only high-profile entrepreneur to engage in a public spat. In 2022, BharatPe's Ashneer Grover engaged in a notorious social media feud with the company's management following his ouster. Similarly, Byju's has faced intense disputes with investors and lenders, though these conflicts played out behind closed doors rather than on social media.Meanwhile, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and a prominent figure in India's startup ecosystem, has been known to take subtle jabs at regulators in private settings, steering clear of public feuds. The company was also forced into posting an apology after Sharma’s tweet in the wake of industrialist Ratan Tata’s passing last week was pilloried on social media.A management consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that a professional manager overseeing a company would have been far more cautious in how they conduct themselves on public platforms.“Public markets want accountability and trust. In a nutshell, that is pretty much all they ask for. It doesn’t matter if the founder is running the company or a professional manager is. All they need is accountability,” said Agrawal of Anand Rathi.“A manager with more professional experience would typically be more controlled in his or her approach and the larger question is whether that’s what the company needs at that stage. Not all founders are able to transition to a professional CEO mindset but more importantly, not all companies need that approach,” Agrawal added.According to the management consultant quoted above, even if companies are run by founders, the founders need to be surrounded with strong advisors, professional management and strong independent directors to avoid any fallout.“What happened with Bhavish could have been stopped at the first tweet. What happened with Byju could have been avoided if he had people advising him properly,” said the management consultant. “You need not replace the founder with a professional person but you have to ensure the founder is surrounded by the right set of people, who are critical and analytical about his or her decisions.”Subramanian agreed with the consultant's view, adding that founders should ensure their company has a competent executive team and a strong board of directors. These leaders should challenge the founder's management decisions rather than simply admiring their every move.“The problem with today’s startups is that the founders have a superstar kind of an aura, so the board of directors today, or even the management, doesn’t question the founder too much,” Subramanian said. “Companies need to institutionalise processes and decision-making. So it is important to have some directors and senior management who have experience and expertise and whose decisions are valued by the founder,” he added.As India’s startups scale and the stakes get raised, the question is fast shifting from whether this change is necessary to when it will happen.*Disclaimer: Shradha Sharma, founder and CEO of YourStory—The CapTable’s parent company—is an independent director in Ola Electric.Edited by Ranjan CrastaOla ElectricPaytmBhavish AggrawalVijay Shekhar Sharmarohit kapoorSwiggyByjus crisisLatest ArticlesMonopoly or convenience?

In 2022, BharatPe's Ashneer Grover engaged in a notorious social media feud with the company's management following his ouster. Similarly, Byju's has faced intense disputes with investors and lenders, though these conflicts played out behind closed doors rather than on social media.Meanwhile, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and a prominent figure in India's startup ecosystem, has been known to take subtle jabs at regulators in private settings, steering clear of public feuds. The company was also forced into posting an apology after Sharma’s tweet in the wake of industrialist Ratan Tata’s passing last week was pilloried on social media.A management consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that a professional manager overseeing a company would have been far more cautious in how they conduct themselves on public platforms.“Public markets want accountability and trust. In a nutshell, that is pretty much all they ask for. It doesn’t matter if the founder is running the company or a professional manager is. All they need is accountability,” said Agrawal of Anand Rathi.“A manager with more professional experience would typically be more controlled in his or her approach and the larger question is whether that’s what the company needs at that stage. Not all founders are able to transition to a professional CEO mindset but more importantly, not all companies need that approach,” Agrawal added.According to the management consultant quoted above, even if companies are run by founders, the founders need to be surrounded with strong advisors, professional management and strong independent directors to avoid any fallout.“What happened with Bhavish could have been stopped at the first tweet. What happened with Byju could have been avoided if he had people advising him properly,” said the management consultant. “You need not replace the founder with a professional person but you have to ensure the founder is surrounded by the right set of people, who are critical and analytical about his or her decisions.”Subramanian agreed with the consultant's view, adding that founders should ensure their company has a competent executive team and a strong board of directors. These leaders should challenge the founder's management decisions rather than simply admiring their every move.“The problem with today’s startups is that the founders have a superstar kind of an aura, so the board of directors today, or even the management, doesn’t question the founder too much,” Subramanian said. “Companies need to institutionalise processes and decision-making. So it is important to have some directors and senior management who have experience and expertise and whose decisions are valued by the founder,” he added.As India’s startups scale and the stakes get raised, the question is fast shifting from whether this change is necessary to when it will happen.*Disclaimer: Shradha Sharma, founder and CEO of YourStory—The CapTable’s parent company—is an independent director in Ola Electric.Edited by Ranjan CrastaOla ElectricPaytmBhavish AggrawalVijay Shekhar Sharmarohit kapoorSwiggyByjus crisisLatest ArticlesMonopoly or convenience?

As these startups grow and evolve, though, a critical consideration arises—are founders best equipped to guide them through their next phase of growth?Key TakeawaysWhile founders' vision has taken major Indian startups to great heights, the need for professional management is increasingly evidentOver the years, excessive founder control has led to many startups, including Byju’s and Housing.com, facing issuesWith more startups slated to go public in coming years, various stakeholders are calling for professional management to ensure stability at startupsStartups such as Swiggy and BharatPe, among others, have bolstered their leadership with professional management and benefited from itIn 2022, foodtech major Swiggy, which was preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), brought in McKinsey alum Rohit Kapoor to lead its core food delivery business. At the time, Swiggy faced fierce competition from the newly listed Zomato, which was rapidly expanding while cutting losses. Kapoor's mission was clear: to turn around Swiggy’s food delivery operations.Two years on, even as Swiggy remains on the precipice of a public listing, Kapoor has successfully turned the company’s food delivery segment profitable. And though Swiggy on a consolidated basis is still burning cash, the profitability of its food marketplace could serve as a blueprint for the company to achieve overall profitability, which is especially crucial as its IPO now seems imminent.Kapoor has also become one of the key public faces of Swiggy, especially given how the company’s founders have historically been little-known outside of business circles.Swiggy is far from the only startup that saw merit in bringing on professional management to overcome obstacles that had proven difficult to tame. Indeed, this wasn’t even Kapoor’s first tryst with steadying a startup ship. Prior to this, he had been enlisted for a similar role at hotel aggregator OYO, which had lost control of its unit economics in its relentless quest for growth.Indeed, while professional management may not appear essential at startups, given that the founders’ vision and determination have been instrumental in major Indian startup successes such as Flipkart and Zomato, that school of thought is increasingly coming under attack.The recent spat between Ola Electric* founder and CEO Bhavish Agarwal and comedian Kunal Kamra over the former’s customer service problems re-ignited the discussion over the need for professional management. Especially since the exchange led to a ~10% fall in Ola Electric’s share price the following day.True, founders often possess a deep understanding of their products and industries, helping them build businesses from scratch. However, as companies scale, they face challenges such as managing complex operations, meeting investor expectations, and achieving sustainable growth.“While initially, high-risk investors like VCs may bet on the founder mentality, as the company becomes larger, lists on stock exchanges, and attracts other sets of investors, management has to focus on decentralising decision-making and focus on institutionalisation and sustainability of the company. There is a need for a more experienced and professional management-led approach,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of corporate governance advisory firm InGovern.To be sure, investors have often emphasised that transitioning from a startup to a larger enterprise may require a different leadership approach. Founders tend to excel in innovation, while professional managers typically bring experience in managing operational complexity, building long-term strategies, and handling stakeholder relations. Investors also view professional management as a signal of stability and maturity.Global companies such as Google and Apple have successfully navigated this transition by integrating professional leadership—such as the roles of Eric Schmidt at Google and Tim Cook at Apple—while maintaining founder influence.“At different stages, companies need different kinds of leaders or for their leaders to evolve. Uber at its inception and aggressive growth phase needed a Travis (Kalanick). There’s very little chance they would have been able to bend the rules and go against age-old regulations and taxi cartels if Travis wasn’t the CEO,” said Aakash Agrawal, Head of Digital and new age business at Anand Rathi Investment Banking.“Then after a certain point of time, as companies blitz-scale and organisations become large, depending on the company, you might need someone like a Dara (Khosrowshahi) to come in and set the house in order. Every founder has their strengths and weaknesses and it’s not about how good a founder is but what’s needed for the company at that particular stage of growth or consolidation”, said Rathi.Infographic: Sharath Ravishankar“Startups and high-growth companies, in particular, need ‘wartime’ and ‘peacetime’ CEOs—think Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. For instance, quick commerce today possibly needs a wartime CEO—a person who can be aggressive and innovate quickly amidst increasing competition,” Rathi added.The fine line between leadership and liabilityIn India, this transition can be more challenging due to concerns among founders about losing control or influence. Additionally, Indian startups are often closely tied to the founders’ personal identities, making it difficult to separate leadership from ownership.In fact, if one asks a venture capitalist why they invested in a company, especially at an early stage, the most common answer is likely, \"We believe in the founders\". The actual idea, market potential, and innovation usually come later.Founders, armed with a compelling vision, have often succeeded in attracting investors at premium valuations. Take Byju Raveendran, for example. A teacher with a humble background from a small town, he lacked the prestigious credentials of institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) or Indian Institutes of Management (IIM), yet he managed to convince global investors to back his company, valuing it as high $22 billion at one point.\"Byju’s ability to sell products and his sheer conviction were so strong that he could sell anything at a premium and people wouldn’t think twice about buying it,\" said one of the company's earliest investors, who has close ties to Raveendran.\"For years, that’s how he approached investors. When Byju was in the room pitching, he was the most convincing person there. Investors were drawn to his conviction, often buying into his story more than the numbers,\" the person added.Infographic: Sharath RavishankarBut the biggest problem with Raveendran and Byju’s, which would eventually lead to the company’s undoing, was the concentration of control he enjoyed. Despite the company growing to become the nation’s most valuable startup, it did not have professional management running the ship. Instead, Raveendran would take all major calls by himself. Consequently, the company, which is now mired in bankruptcy proceedings, witnessed high-profile boardroom drama, with its biggest shareholders attempting to oust Raveendran and his management team as they sought to rescue the spiralling company.Byju’s and other startups seem to be in trouble because the founder seemed to be making all the decisions. There is a sense of star power to the founders and even the Boards of these companies were in the dark on many decisions,” said Subramanian of InGovern.Much like Raveendran, a number of India’s startup poster boys—from Rahul Yadav of Housing.com to Ashneer Grover of BharatPe—have gone from being investor darlings to problem children. As their success grew, they often stopped heeding investor advice, which eventually contributed to their own downfall or that of their companies or both.“These are all cautionary tales. It is very difficult to get into a founder’s mindset because it keeps changing with the market situation. At times, they go behind aggressive expansion depending on many factors that are at play and, at times, they have to cut down on expenses and think about cash flow and business stability. VCs have an important role in such cases as companies evolve from one stage to another. They are akin to ‘professional management’ until the company actually gets to a stable state and has systems, processes, and personnel that ensure quality corporate governance,” said Agrawal.“While VCs are not driving, they are navigating a rapidly changing environment and if things go wrong, the navigator must also share the blame. That’s where a VC’s experience and bird’s-eye view come in handy—they have to set reasonable expectations, either aggressive or cautious, depending on incoming headwinds or tailwinds. They are the able shoulders that can help a founder be pragmatic while building a team that can bring varied skill sets and thought processes to the table. Of course, early-stage VCs need to be founder-centric but also lay down the gauntlet as the company matures to help build a more consensus-driven culture that focuses on the key stakeholders—customer, employees, and shareholders” he added.Perception mattersThe need for a more professional approach becomes even more urgent when startups list on the bourses, subjecting themselves to a higher degree of both regulatory and public scrutiny, as Ola Electric’s Aggarwal found last week. The spat, which came across as petty, had severe consequences. The drop in Ola Electric’s share price that followed saw its market capitalisation fall below $5 billion for the first time since it went public in August.A source close to Aggarwal revealed that he initially expected to gain public support, as he has in the past on several controversial issues. However, Ola Electric has faced significant criticism, particularly regarding the quality of its scooters and, more notably, its customer service. Aggarwals’ move to criticise Kamra, thus, backfired.“Bhavish has to learn to react more maturely. There have been many other instances of fights where business leaders have been involved. But those business leaders maintained decorum even when expressing their anger while justifying their case,” said Subramanian.“When one is in a customer-facing business and if the product has been ordinary, there will be service issues and customer backlash. In such cases, the founder has to have a sense of gravitas in addressing questions. Bhavish could have responded to the allegations in a more mature manner. Serious investors in the listed company do consider the behaviour of management into their investing framework and newly listed companies have to understand this,” Subramanian added.It's worth noting that Bhavish Aggarwal isn't the only high-profile entrepreneur to engage in a public spat. In 2022, BharatPe's Ashneer Grover engaged in a notorious social media feud with the company's management following his ouster. Similarly, Byju's has faced intense disputes with investors and lenders, though these conflicts played out behind closed doors rather than on social media.Meanwhile, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and a prominent figure in India's startup ecosystem, has been known to take subtle jabs at regulators in private settings, steering clear of public feuds.

As these startups grow and evolve, though, a critical consideration arises—are founders best equipped to guide them through their next phase of growth?Key TakeawaysWhile founders' vision has taken major Indian startups to great heights, the need for professional management is increasingly evidentOver the years, excessive founder control has led to many startups, including Byju’s and Housing.com, facing issuesWith more startups slated to go public in coming years, various stakeholders are calling for professional management to ensure stability at startupsStartups such as Swiggy and BharatPe, among others, have bolstered their leadership with professional management and benefited from itIn 2022, foodtech major Swiggy, which was preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), brought in McKinsey alum Rohit Kapoor to lead its core food delivery business. At the time, Swiggy faced fierce competition from the newly listed Zomato, which was rapidly expanding while cutting losses. Kapoor's mission was clear: to turn around Swiggy’s food delivery operations.Two years on, even as Swiggy remains on the precipice of a public listing, Kapoor has successfully turned the company’s food delivery segment profitable. And though Swiggy on a consolidated basis is still burning cash, the profitability of its food marketplace could serve as a blueprint for the company to achieve overall profitability, which is especially crucial as its IPO now seems imminent.Kapoor has also become one of the key public faces of Swiggy, especially given how the company’s founders have historically been little-known outside of business circles.Swiggy is far from the only startup that saw merit in bringing on professional management to overcome obstacles that had proven difficult to tame. Indeed, this wasn’t even Kapoor’s first tryst with steadying a startup ship. Prior to this, he had been enlisted for a similar role at hotel aggregator OYO, which had lost control of its unit economics in its relentless quest for growth.Indeed, while professional management may not appear essential at startups, given that the founders’ vision and determination have been instrumental in major Indian startup successes such as Flipkart and Zomato, that school of thought is increasingly coming under attack.The recent spat between Ola Electric* founder and CEO Bhavish Agarwal and comedian Kunal Kamra over the former’s customer service problems re-ignited the discussion over the need for professional management. Especially since the exchange led to a ~10% fall in Ola Electric’s share price the following day.True, founders often possess a deep understanding of their products and industries, helping them build businesses from scratch. However, as companies scale, they face challenges such as managing complex operations, meeting investor expectations, and achieving sustainable growth.“While initially, high-risk investors like VCs may bet on the founder mentality, as the company becomes larger, lists on stock exchanges, and attracts other sets of investors, management has to focus on decentralising decision-making and focus on institutionalisation and sustainability of the company. There is a need for a more experienced and professional management-led approach,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of corporate governance advisory firm InGovern.To be sure, investors have often emphasised that transitioning from a startup to a larger enterprise may require a different leadership approach. Founders tend to excel in innovation, while professional managers typically bring experience in managing operational complexity, building long-term strategies, and handling stakeholder relations. Investors also view professional management as a signal of stability and maturity.Global companies such as Google and Apple have successfully navigated this transition by integrating professional leadership—such as the roles of Eric Schmidt at Google and Tim Cook at Apple—while maintaining founder influence.“At different stages, companies need different kinds of leaders or for their leaders to evolve. Uber at its inception and aggressive growth phase needed a Travis (Kalanick). There’s very little chance they would have been able to bend the rules and go against age-old regulations and taxi cartels if Travis wasn’t the CEO,” said Aakash Agrawal, Head of Digital and new age business at Anand Rathi Investment Banking.“Then after a certain point of time, as companies blitz-scale and organisations become large, depending on the company, you might need someone like a Dara (Khosrowshahi) to come in and set the house in order. Every founder has their strengths and weaknesses and it’s not about how good a founder is but what’s needed for the company at that particular stage of growth or consolidation”, said Rathi.Infographic: Sharath Ravishankar“Startups and high-growth companies, in particular, need ‘wartime’ and ‘peacetime’ CEOs—think Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. For instance, quick commerce today possibly needs a wartime CEO—a person who can be aggressive and innovate quickly amidst increasing competition,” Rathi added.The fine line between leadership and liabilityIn India, this transition can be more challenging due to concerns among founders about losing control or influence. Additionally, Indian startups are often closely tied to the founders’ personal identities, making it difficult to separate leadership from ownership.In fact, if one asks a venture capitalist why they invested in a company, especially at an early stage, the most common answer is likely, \"We believe in the founders\". The actual idea, market potential, and innovation usually come later.Founders, armed with a compelling vision, have often succeeded in attracting investors at premium valuations. Take Byju Raveendran, for example. A teacher with a humble background from a small town, he lacked the prestigious credentials of institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) or Indian Institutes of Management (IIM), yet he managed to convince global investors to back his company, valuing it as high $22 billion at one point.\"Byju’s ability to sell products and his sheer conviction were so strong that he could sell anything at a premium and people wouldn’t think twice about buying it,\" said one of the company's earliest investors, who has close ties to Raveendran.\"For years, that’s how he approached investors. When Byju was in the room pitching, he was the most convincing person there. Investors were drawn to his conviction, often buying into his story more than the numbers,\" the person added.Infographic: Sharath RavishankarBut the biggest problem with Raveendran and Byju’s, which would eventually lead to the company’s undoing, was the concentration of control he enjoyed. Despite the company growing to become the nation’s most valuable startup, it did not have professional management running the ship. Instead, Raveendran would take all major calls by himself. Consequently, the company, which is now mired in bankruptcy proceedings, witnessed high-profile boardroom drama, with its biggest shareholders attempting to oust Raveendran and his management team as they sought to rescue the spiralling company.Byju’s and other startups seem to be in trouble because the founder seemed to be making all the decisions. There is a sense of star power to the founders and even the Boards of these companies were in the dark on many decisions,” said Subramanian of InGovern.Much like Raveendran, a number of India’s startup poster boys—from Rahul Yadav of Housing.com to Ashneer Grover of BharatPe—have gone from being investor darlings to problem children. As their success grew, they often stopped heeding investor advice, which eventually contributed to their own downfall or that of their companies or both.“These are all cautionary tales. It is very difficult to get into a founder’s mindset because it keeps changing with the market situation. At times, they go behind aggressive expansion depending on many factors that are at play and, at times, they have to cut down on expenses and think about cash flow and business stability. VCs have an important role in such cases as companies evolve from one stage to another. They are akin to ‘professional management’ until the company actually gets to a stable state and has systems, processes, and personnel that ensure quality corporate governance,” said Agrawal.“While VCs are not driving, they are navigating a rapidly changing environment and if things go wrong, the navigator must also share the blame. That’s where a VC’s experience and bird’s-eye view come in handy—they have to set reasonable expectations, either aggressive or cautious, depending on incoming headwinds or tailwinds. They are the able shoulders that can help a founder be pragmatic while building a team that can bring varied skill sets and thought processes to the table. Of course, early-stage VCs need to be founder-centric but also lay down the gauntlet as the company matures to help build a more consensus-driven culture that focuses on the key stakeholders—customer, employees, and shareholders” he added.Perception mattersThe need for a more professional approach becomes even more urgent when startups list on the bourses, subjecting themselves to a higher degree of both regulatory and public scrutiny, as Ola Electric’s Aggarwal found last week. The spat, which came across as petty, had severe consequences. The drop in Ola Electric’s share price that followed saw its market capitalisation fall below $5 billion for the first time since it went public in August.A source close to Aggarwal revealed that he initially expected to gain public support, as he has in the past on several controversial issues. However, Ola Electric has faced significant criticism, particularly regarding the quality of its scooters and, more notably, its customer service. Aggarwals’ move to criticise Kamra, thus, backfired.“Bhavish has to learn to react more maturely. There have been many other instances of fights where business leaders have been involved. But those business leaders maintained decorum even when expressing their anger while justifying their case,” said Subramanian.“When one is in a customer-facing business and if the product has been ordinary, there will be service issues and customer backlash. In such cases, the founder has to have a sense of gravitas in addressing questions. Bhavish could have responded to the allegations in a more mature manner. Serious investors in the listed company do consider the behaviour of management into their investing framework and newly listed companies have to understand this,” Subramanian added.It's worth noting that Bhavish Aggarwal isn't the only high-profile entrepreneur to engage in a public spat. In 2022, BharatPe's Ashneer Grover engaged in a notorious social media feud with the company's management following his ouster. Similarly, Byju's has faced intense disputes with investors and lenders, though these conflicts played out behind closed doors rather than on social media.Meanwhile, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and a prominent figure in India's startup ecosystem, has been known to take subtle jabs at regulators in private settings, steering clear of public feuds. The company was also forced into posting an apology after Sharma’s tweet in the wake of industrialist Ratan Tata’s passing last week was pilloried on social media.A management consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that a professional manager overseeing a company would have been far more cautious in how they conduct themselves on public platforms.“Public markets want accountability and trust. In a nutshell, that is pretty much all they ask for. It doesn’t matter if the founder is running the company or a professional manager is. All they need is accountability,” said Agrawal of Anand Rathi.“A manager with more professional experience would typically be more controlled in his or her approach and the larger question is whether that’s what the company needs at that stage. Not all founders are able to transition to a professional CEO mindset but more importantly, not all companies need that approach,” Agrawal added.According to the management consultant quoted above, even if companies are run by founders, the founders need to be surrounded with strong advisors, professional management and strong independent directors to avoid any fallout.“What happened with Bhavish could have been stopped at the first tweet. What happened with Byju could have been avoided if he had people advising him properly,” said the management consultant. “You need not replace the founder with a professional person but you have to ensure the founder is surrounded by the right set of people, who are critical and analytical about his or her decisions.”Subramanian agreed with the consultant's view, adding that founders should ensure their company has a competent executive team and a strong board of directors. These leaders should challenge the founder's management decisions rather than simply admiring their every move.“The problem with today’s startups is that the founders have a superstar kind of an aura, so the board of directors today, or even the management, doesn’t question the founder too much,” Subramanian said. “Companies need to institutionalise processes and decision-making. So it is important to have some directors and senior management who have experience and expertise and whose decisions are valued by the founder,” he added.As India’s startups scale and the stakes get raised, the question is fast shifting from whether this change is necessary to when it will happen.*Disclaimer: Shradha Sharma, founder and CEO of YourStory—The CapTable’s parent company—is an independent director in Ola Electric.Edited by Ranjan CrastaOla ElectricPaytmBhavish AggrawalVijay Shekhar Sharmarohit kapoorSwiggyByjus crisisLatest ArticlesMonopoly or convenience?

A teacher with a humble background from a small town, he lacked the prestigious credentials of institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) or Indian Institutes of Management (IIM), yet he managed to convince global investors to back his company, valuing it as high $22 billion at one point.\"Byju’s ability to sell products and his sheer conviction were so strong that he could sell anything at a premium and people wouldn’t think twice about buying it,\" said one of the company's earliest investors, who has close ties to Raveendran.\"For years, that’s how he approached investors. When Byju was in the room pitching, he was the most convincing person there. Investors were drawn to his conviction, often buying into his story more than the numbers,\" the person added.Infographic: Sharath RavishankarBut the biggest problem with Raveendran and Byju’s, which would eventually lead to the company’s undoing, was the concentration of control he enjoyed. Despite the company growing to become the nation’s most valuable startup, it did not have professional management running the ship. Instead, Raveendran would take all major calls by himself. Consequently, the company, which is now mired in bankruptcy proceedings, witnessed high-profile boardroom drama, with its biggest shareholders attempting to oust Raveendran and his management team as they sought to rescue the spiralling company.Byju’s and other startups seem to be in trouble because the founder seemed to be making all the decisions. There is a sense of star power to the founders and even the Boards of these companies were in the dark on many decisions,” said Subramanian of InGovern.Much like Raveendran, a number of India’s startup poster boys—from Rahul Yadav of Housing.com to Ashneer Grover of BharatPe—have gone from being investor darlings to problem children. As their success grew, they often stopped heeding investor advice, which eventually contributed to their own downfall or that of their companies or both.“These are all cautionary tales. It is very difficult to get into a founder’s mindset because it keeps changing with the market situation. At times, they go behind aggressive expansion depending on many factors that are at play and, at times, they have to cut down on expenses and think about cash flow and business stability. VCs have an important role in such cases as companies evolve from one stage to another. They are akin to ‘professional management’ until the company actually gets to a stable state and has systems, processes, and personnel that ensure quality corporate governance,” said Agrawal.“While VCs are not driving, they are navigating a rapidly changing environment and if things go wrong, the navigator must also share the blame. That’s where a VC’s experience and bird’s-eye view come in handy—they have to set reasonable expectations, either aggressive or cautious, depending on incoming headwinds or tailwinds. They are the able shoulders that can help a founder be pragmatic while building a team that can bring varied skill sets and thought processes to the table. Of course, early-stage VCs need to be founder-centric but also lay down the gauntlet as the company matures to help build a more consensus-driven culture that focuses on the key stakeholders—customer, employees, and shareholders” he added.Perception mattersThe need for a more professional approach becomes even more urgent when startups list on the bourses, subjecting themselves to a higher degree of both regulatory and public scrutiny, as Ola Electric’s Aggarwal found last week. The spat, which came across as petty, had severe consequences. The drop in Ola Electric’s share price that followed saw its market capitalisation fall below $5 billion for the first time since it went public in August.A source close to Aggarwal revealed that he initially expected to gain public support, as he has in the past on several controversial issues. However, Ola Electric has faced significant criticism, particularly regarding the quality of its scooters and, more notably, its customer service. Aggarwals’ move to criticise Kamra, thus, backfired.“Bhavish has to learn to react more maturely. There have been many other instances of fights where business leaders have been involved. But those business leaders maintained decorum even when expressing their anger while justifying their case,” said Subramanian.“When one is in a customer-facing business and if the product has been ordinary, there will be service issues and customer backlash. In such cases, the founder has to have a sense of gravitas in addressing questions. Bhavish could have responded to the allegations in a more mature manner. Serious investors in the listed company do consider the behaviour of management into their investing framework and newly listed companies have to understand this,” Subramanian added.It's worth noting that Bhavish Aggarwal isn't the only high-profile entrepreneur to engage in a public spat. In 2022, BharatPe's Ashneer Grover engaged in a notorious social media feud with the company's management following his ouster. Similarly, Byju's has faced intense disputes with investors and lenders, though these conflicts played out behind closed doors rather than on social media.Meanwhile, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and a prominent figure in India's startup ecosystem, has been known to take subtle jabs at regulators in private settings, steering clear of public feuds. The company was also forced into posting an apology after Sharma’s tweet in the wake of industrialist Ratan Tata’s passing last week was pilloried on social media.A management consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that a professional manager overseeing a company would have been far more cautious in how they conduct themselves on public platforms.“Public markets want accountability and trust. In a nutshell, that is pretty much all they ask for. It doesn’t matter if the founder is running the company or a professional manager is. All they need is accountability,” said Agrawal of Anand Rathi.“A manager with more professional experience would typically be more controlled in his or her approach and the larger question is whether that’s what the company needs at that stage. Not all founders are able to transition to a professional CEO mindset but more importantly, not all companies need that approach,” Agrawal added.According to the management consultant quoted above, even if companies are run by founders, the founders need to be surrounded with strong advisors, professional management and strong independent directors to avoid any fallout.“What happened with Bhavish could have been stopped at the first tweet. What happened with Byju could have been avoided if he had people advising him properly,” said the management consultant. “You need not replace the founder with a professional person but you have to ensure the founder is surrounded by the right set of people, who are critical and analytical about his or her decisions.”Subramanian agreed with the consultant's view, adding that founders should ensure their company has a competent executive team and a strong board of directors. These leaders should challenge the founder's management decisions rather than simply admiring their every move.“The problem with today’s startups is that the founders have a superstar kind of an aura, so the board of directors today, or even the management, doesn’t question the founder too much,” Subramanian said. “Companies need to institutionalise processes and decision-making. So it is important to have some directors and senior management who have experience and expertise and whose decisions are valued by the founder,” he added.As India’s startups scale and the stakes get raised, the question is fast shifting from whether this change is necessary to when it will happen.*Disclaimer: Shradha Sharma, founder and CEO of YourStory—The CapTable’s parent company—is an independent director in Ola Electric.Edited by Ranjan CrastaOla ElectricPaytmBhavish AggrawalVijay Shekhar Sharmarohit kapoorSwiggyByjus crisisLatest ArticlesMonopoly or convenience?

As these startups grow and evolve, though, a critical consideration arises—are founders best equipped to guide them through their next phase of growth?Key TakeawaysWhile founders' vision has taken major Indian startups to great heights, the need for professional management is increasingly evidentOver the years, excessive founder control has led to many startups, including Byju’s and Housing.com, facing issuesWith more startups slated to go public in coming years, various stakeholders are calling for professional management to ensure stability at startupsStartups such as Swiggy and BharatPe, among others, have bolstered their leadership with professional management and benefited from itIn 2022, foodtech major Swiggy, which was preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), brought in McKinsey alum Rohit Kapoor to lead its core food delivery business. At the time, Swiggy faced fierce competition from the newly listed Zomato, which was rapidly expanding while cutting losses. Kapoor's mission was clear: to turn around Swiggy’s food delivery operations.Two years on, even as Swiggy remains on the precipice of a public listing, Kapoor has successfully turned the company’s food delivery segment profitable. And though Swiggy on a consolidated basis is still burning cash, the profitability of its food marketplace could serve as a blueprint for the company to achieve overall profitability, which is especially crucial as its IPO now seems imminent.Kapoor has also become one of the key public faces of Swiggy, especially given how the company’s founders have historically been little-known outside of business circles.Swiggy is far from the only startup that saw merit in bringing on professional management to overcome obstacles that had proven difficult to tame. Indeed, this wasn’t even Kapoor’s first tryst with steadying a startup ship. Prior to this, he had been enlisted for a similar role at hotel aggregator OYO, which had lost control of its unit economics in its relentless quest for growth.Indeed, while professional management may not appear essential at startups, given that the founders’ vision and determination have been instrumental in major Indian startup successes such as Flipkart and Zomato, that school of thought is increasingly coming under attack.The recent spat between Ola Electric* founder and CEO Bhavish Agarwal and comedian Kunal Kamra over the former’s customer service problems re-ignited the discussion over the need for professional management. Especially since the exchange led to a ~10% fall in Ola Electric’s share price the following day.True, founders often possess a deep understanding of their products and industries, helping them build businesses from scratch. However, as companies scale, they face challenges such as managing complex operations, meeting investor expectations, and achieving sustainable growth.“While initially, high-risk investors like VCs may bet on the founder mentality, as the company becomes larger, lists on stock exchanges, and attracts other sets of investors, management has to focus on decentralising decision-making and focus on institutionalisation and sustainability of the company. There is a need for a more experienced and professional management-led approach,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of corporate governance advisory firm InGovern.To be sure, investors have often emphasised that transitioning from a startup to a larger enterprise may require a different leadership approach. Founders tend to excel in innovation, while professional managers typically bring experience in managing operational complexity, building long-term strategies, and handling stakeholder relations. Investors also view professional management as a signal of stability and maturity.Global companies such as Google and Apple have successfully navigated this transition by integrating professional leadership—such as the roles of Eric Schmidt at Google and Tim Cook at Apple—while maintaining founder influence.“At different stages, companies need different kinds of leaders or for their leaders to evolve. Uber at its inception and aggressive growth phase needed a Travis (Kalanick). There’s very little chance they would have been able to bend the rules and go against age-old regulations and taxi cartels if Travis wasn’t the CEO,” said Aakash Agrawal, Head of Digital and new age business at Anand Rathi Investment Banking.“Then after a certain point of time, as companies blitz-scale and organisations become large, depending on the company, you might need someone like a Dara (Khosrowshahi) to come in and set the house in order. Every founder has their strengths and weaknesses and it’s not about how good a founder is but what’s needed for the company at that particular stage of growth or consolidation”, said Rathi.Infographic: Sharath Ravishankar“Startups and high-growth companies, in particular, need ‘wartime’ and ‘peacetime’ CEOs—think Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. For instance, quick commerce today possibly needs a wartime CEO—a person who can be aggressive and innovate quickly amidst increasing competition,” Rathi added.The fine line between leadership and liabilityIn India, this transition can be more challenging due to concerns among founders about losing control or influence. Additionally, Indian startups are often closely tied to the founders’ personal identities, making it difficult to separate leadership from ownership.In fact, if one asks a venture capitalist why they invested in a company, especially at an early stage, the most common answer is likely, \"We believe in the founders\". The actual idea, market potential, and innovation usually come later.Founders, armed with a compelling vision, have often succeeded in attracting investors at premium valuations. Take Byju Raveendran, for example.

In 2022, BharatPe's Ashneer Grover engaged in a notorious social media feud with the company's management following his ouster. Similarly, Byju's has faced intense disputes with investors and lenders, though these conflicts played out behind closed doors rather than on social media.Meanwhile, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and a prominent figure in India's startup ecosystem, has been known to take subtle jabs at regulators in private settings, steering clear of public feuds. The company was also forced into posting an apology after Sharma’s tweet in the wake of industrialist Ratan Tata’s passing last week was pilloried on social media.A management consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that a professional manager overseeing a company would have been far more cautious in how they conduct themselves on public platforms.“Public markets want accountability and trust. In a nutshell, that is pretty much all they ask for. It doesn’t matter if the founder is running the company or a professional manager is. All they need is accountability,” said Agrawal of Anand Rathi.“A manager with more professional experience would typically be more controlled in his or her approach and the larger question is whether that’s what the company needs at that stage. Not all founders are able to transition to a professional CEO mindset but more importantly, not all companies need that approach,” Agrawal added.According to the management consultant quoted above, even if companies are run by founders, the founders need to be surrounded with strong advisors, professional management and strong independent directors to avoid any fallout.“What happened with Bhavish could have been stopped at the first tweet. What happened with Byju could have been avoided if he had people advising him properly,” said the management consultant. “You need not replace the founder with a professional person but you have to ensure the founder is surrounded by the right set of people, who are critical and analytical about his or her decisions.”Subramanian agreed with the consultant's view, adding that founders should ensure their company has a competent executive team and a strong board of directors. These leaders should challenge the founder's management decisions rather than simply admiring their every move.“The problem with today’s startups is that the founders have a superstar kind of an aura, so the board of directors today, or even the management, doesn’t question the founder too much,” Subramanian said. “Companies need to institutionalise processes and decision-making. So it is important to have some directors and senior management who have experience and expertise and whose decisions are valued by the founder,” he added.As India’s startups scale and the stakes get raised, the question is fast shifting from whether this change is necessary to when it will happen.*Disclaimer: Shradha Sharma, founder and CEO of YourStory—The CapTable’s parent company—is an independent director in Ola Electric.Edited by Ranjan Crasta Key TakeawaysWhile founders' vision has taken major Indian startups to great heights, the need for professional management is increasingly evidentOver the years, excessive founder control has led to many startups, including Byju’s and Housing.com, facing issuesWith more startups slated to go public in coming years, various stakeholders are calling for professional management to ensure stability at startupsStartups such as Swiggy and BharatPe, among others, have bolstered their leadership with professional management and benefited from itIn 2022, foodtech major Swiggy, which was preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), brought in McKinsey alum Rohit Kapoor to lead its core food delivery business.

Kapoor's mission was clear: to turn around Swiggy’s food delivery operations.Two years on, even as Swiggy remains on the precipice of a public listing, Kapoor has successfully turned the company’s food delivery segment profitable.

Indeed, this wasn’t even Kapoor’s first tryst with steadying a startup ship. Prior to this, he had been enlisted for a similar role at hotel aggregator OYO, which had lost control of its unit economics in its relentless quest for growth.Indeed, while professional management may not appear essential at startups, given that the founders’ vision and determination have been instrumental in major Indian startup successes such as Flipkart and Zomato, that school of thought is increasingly coming under attack.The recent spat between Ola Electric* founder and CEO Bhavish Agarwal and comedian Kunal Kamra over the former’s customer service problems re-ignited the discussion over the need for professional management.

However, as companies scale, they face challenges such as managing complex operations, meeting investor expectations, and achieving sustainable growth.“While initially, high-risk investors like VCs may bet on the founder mentality, as the company becomes larger, lists on stock exchanges, and attracts other sets of investors, management has to focus on decentralising decision-making and focus on institutionalisation and sustainability of the company. There is a need for a more experienced and professional management-led approach,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder of corporate governance advisory firm InGovern.To be sure, investors have often emphasised that transitioning from a startup to a larger enterprise may require a different leadership approach. Founders tend to excel in innovation, while professional managers typically bring experience in managing operational complexity, building long-term strategies, and handling stakeholder relations. Investors also view professional management as a signal of stability and maturity.Global companies such as Google and Apple have successfully navigated this transition by integrating professional leadership—such as the roles of Eric Schmidt at Google and Tim Cook at Apple—while maintaining founder influence.“At different stages, companies need different kinds of leaders or for their leaders to evolve. Uber at its inception and aggressive growth phase needed a Travis (Kalanick). There’s very little chance they would have been able to bend the rules and go against age-old regulations and taxi cartels if Travis wasn’t the CEO,” said Aakash Agrawal, Head of Digital and new age business at Anand Rathi Investment Banking.“Then after a certain point of time, as companies blitz-scale and organisations become large, depending on the company, you might need someone like a Dara (Khosrowshahi) to come in and set the house in order. Every founder has their strengths and weaknesses and it’s not about how good a founder is but what’s needed for the company at that particular stage of growth or consolidation”, said Rathi.Infographic: Sharath Ravishankar“Startups and high-growth companies, in particular, need ‘wartime’ and ‘peacetime’ CEOs—think Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. For instance, quick commerce today possibly needs a wartime CEO—a person who can be aggressive and innovate quickly amidst increasing competition,” Rathi added.The fine line between leadership and liabilityIn India, this transition can be more challenging due to concerns among founders about losing control or influence. Additionally, Indian startups are often closely tied to the founders’ personal identities, making it difficult to separate leadership from ownership.In fact, if one asks a venture capitalist why they invested in a company, especially at an early stage, the most common answer is likely, \"We believe in the founders\". The actual idea, market potential, and innovation usually come later.Founders, armed with a compelling vision, have often succeeded in attracting investors at premium valuations. Take Byju Raveendran, for example. A teacher with a humble background from a small town, he lacked the prestigious credentials of institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) or Indian Institutes of Management (IIM), yet he managed to convince global investors to back his company, valuing it as high $22 billion at one point.\"Byju’s ability to sell products and his sheer conviction were so strong that he could sell anything at a premium and people wouldn’t think twice about buying it,\" said one of the company's earliest investors, who has close ties to Raveendran.\"For years, that’s how he approached investors. When Byju was in the room pitching, he was the most convincing person there. Investors were drawn to his conviction, often buying into his story more than the numbers,\" the person added.Infographic: Sharath RavishankarBut the biggest problem with Raveendran and Byju’s, which would eventually lead to the company’s undoing, was the concentration of control he enjoyed. Despite the company growing to become the nation’s most valuable startup, it did not have professional management running the ship. Instead, Raveendran would take all major calls by himself. Consequently, the company, which is now mired in bankruptcy proceedings, witnessed high-profile boardroom drama, with its biggest shareholders attempting to oust Raveendran and his management team as they sought to rescue the spiralling company.Byju’s and other startups seem to be in trouble because the founder seemed to be making all the decisions. There is a sense of star power to the founders and even the Boards of these companies were in the dark on many decisions,” said Subramanian of InGovern.Much like Raveendran, a number of India’s startup poster boys—from Rahul Yadav of Housing.com to Ashneer Grover of BharatPe—have gone from being investor darlings to problem children. As their success grew, they often stopped heeding investor advice, which eventually contributed to their own downfall or that of their companies or both.“These are all cautionary tales. It is very difficult to get into a founder’s mindset because it keeps changing with the market situation. At times, they go behind aggressive expansion depending on many factors that are at play and, at times, they have to cut down on expenses and think about cash flow and business stability. VCs have an important role in such cases as companies evolve from one stage to another. They are akin to ‘professional management’ until the company actually gets to a stable state and has systems, processes, and personnel that ensure quality corporate governance,” said Agrawal.“While VCs are not driving, they are navigating a rapidly changing environment and if things go wrong, the navigator must also share the blame. That’s where a VC’s experience and bird’s-eye view come in handy—they have to set reasonable expectations, either aggressive or cautious, depending on incoming headwinds or tailwinds. They are the able shoulders that can help a founder be pragmatic while building a team that can bring varied skill sets and thought processes to the table. Of course, early-stage VCs need to be founder-centric but also lay down the gauntlet as the company matures to help build a more consensus-driven culture that focuses on the key stakeholders—customer, employees, and shareholders” he added.Perception mattersThe need for a more professional approach becomes even more urgent when startups list on the bourses, subjecting themselves to a higher degree of both regulatory and public scrutiny, as Ola Electric’s Aggarwal found last week. The spat, which came across as petty, had severe consequences. The drop in Ola Electric’s share price that followed saw its market capitalisation fall below $5 billion for the first time since it went public in August.A source close to Aggarwal revealed that he initially expected to gain public support, as he has in the past on several controversial issues. However, Ola Electric has faced significant criticism, particularly regarding the quality of its scooters and, more notably, its customer service. Aggarwals’ move to criticise Kamra, thus, backfired.“Bhavish has to learn to react more maturely. There have been many other instances of fights where business leaders have been involved. But those business leaders maintained decorum even when expressing their anger while justifying their case,” said Subramanian.“When one is in a customer-facing business and if the product has been ordinary, there will be service issues and customer backlash. In such cases, the founder has to have a sense of gravitas in addressing questions. Bhavish could have responded to the allegations in a more mature manner. Serious investors in the listed company do consider the behaviour of management into their investing framework and newly listed companies have to understand this,” Subramanian added.It's worth noting that Bhavish Aggarwal isn't the only high-profile entrepreneur to engage in a public spat.

To be sure, investors have often emphasised that transitioning from a startup to a larger enterprise may require a different leadership approach. Founders tend to excel in innovation, while professional managers typically bring experience in managing operational complexity, building long-term strategies, and handling stakeholder relations. Investors also view professional management as a signal of stability and maturity. Global companies such as Google and Apple have successfully navigated this transition by integrating professional leadership—such as the roles of Eric Schmidt at Google and Tim Cook at Apple—while maintaining founder influence.

Uber at its inception and aggressive growth phase needed a Travis (Kalanick). There’s very little chance they would have been able to bend the rules and go against age-old regulations and taxi cartels if Travis wasn’t the CEO,” said Aakash Agrawal, Head of Digital and new age business at Anand Rathi Investment Banking. “At different stages, companies need different kinds of leaders or for their leaders to evolve.

Every founder has their strengths and weaknesses and it’s not about how good a founder is but what’s needed for the company at that particular stage of growth or consolidation”, said Rathi. “Then after a certain point of time, as companies blitz-scale and organisations become large, depending on the company, you might need someone like a Dara (Khosrowshahi) to come in and set the house in order.

For instance, quick commerce today possibly needs a wartime CEO—a person who can be aggressive and innovate quickly amidst increasing competition,” Rathi added. “Startups and high-growth companies, in particular, need ‘wartime’ and ‘peacetime’ CEOs—think Steve Jobs and Tim Cook.

The fine line between leadership and liability The fine line between leadership and liability In India, this transition can be more challenging due to concerns among founders about losing control or influence. Additionally, Indian startups are often closely tied to the founders’ personal identities, making it difficult to separate leadership from ownership.

In fact, if one asks a venture capitalist why they invested in a company, especially at an early stage, the most common answer is likely, \"We believe in the founders\". The actual idea, market potential, and innovation usually come later.

Take Byju Raveendran, for example. A teacher with a humble background from a small town, he lacked the prestigious credentials of institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) or Indian Institutes of Management (IIM), yet he managed to convince global investors to back his company, valuing it as high $22 billion at one point.

When Byju was in the room pitching, he was the most convincing person there. Investors were drawn to his conviction, often buying into his story more than the numbers,\" the person added. \"For years, that’s how he approached investors.

Despite the company growing to become the nation’s most valuable startup, it did not have professional management running the ship. Instead, Raveendran would take all major calls by himself. Consequently, the company, which is now mired in bankruptcy proceedings, witnessed high-profile boardroom drama, with its biggest shareholders attempting to oust Raveendran and his management team as they sought to rescue the spiralling company.

Byju’s and other startups seem to be in trouble because the founder seemed to be making all the decisions. There is a sense of star power to the founders and even the Boards of these companies were in the dark on many decisions,” said Subramanian of InGovern.

Much like Raveendran, a number of India’s startup poster boys—from Rahul Yadav of Housing.com to Ashneer Grover of BharatPe—have gone from being investor darlings to problem children. As their success grew, they often stopped heeding investor advice, which eventually contributed to their own downfall or that of their companies or both.

It is very difficult to get into a founder’s mindset because it keeps changing with the market situation. At times, they go behind aggressive expansion depending on many factors that are at play and, at times, they have to cut down on expenses and think about cash flow and business stability. VCs have an important role in such cases as companies evolve from one stage to another. They are akin to ‘professional management’ until the company actually gets to a stable state and has systems, processes, and personnel that ensure quality corporate governance,” said Agrawal. “These are all cautionary tales.

That’s where a VC’s experience and bird’s-eye view come in handy—they have to set reasonable expectations, either aggressive or cautious, depending on incoming headwinds or tailwinds. They are the able shoulders that can help a founder be pragmatic while building a team that can bring varied skill sets and thought processes to the table. Of course, early-stage VCs need to be founder-centric but also lay down the gauntlet as the company matures to help build a more consensus-driven culture that focuses on the key stakeholders—customer, employees, and shareholders” he added. “While VCs are not driving, they are navigating a rapidly changing environment and if things go wrong, the navigator must also share the blame.

Perception matters Perception matters The need for a more professional approach becomes even more urgent when startups list on the bourses, subjecting themselves to a higher degree of both regulatory and public scrutiny, as Ola Electric’s Aggarwal found last week. The spat, which came across as petty, had severe consequences. The drop in Ola Electric’s share price that followed saw its market capitalisation fall below $5 billion for the first time since it went public in August.

A source close to Aggarwal revealed that he initially expected to gain public support, as he has in the past on several controversial issues. However, Ola Electric has faced significant criticism, particularly regarding the quality of its scooters and, more notably, its customer service. Aggarwals’ move to criticise Kamra, thus, backfired.

But those business leaders maintained decorum even when expressing their anger while justifying their case,” said Subramanian. “Bhavish has to learn to react more maturely.

In such cases, the founder has to have a sense of gravitas in addressing questions. Bhavish could have responded to the allegations in a more mature manner. Serious investors in the listed company do consider the behaviour of management into their investing framework and newly listed companies have to understand this,” Subramanian added. “When one is in a customer-facing business and if the product has been ordinary, there will be service issues and customer backlash.

It's worth noting that Bhavish Aggarwal isn't the only high-profile entrepreneur to engage in a public spat. In 2022, BharatPe's Ashneer Grover engaged in a notorious social media feud with the company's management following his ouster. Similarly, Byju's has faced intense disputes with investors and lenders, though these conflicts played out behind closed doors rather than on social media.

Meanwhile, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of Paytm and a prominent figure in India's startup ecosystem, has been known to take subtle jabs at regulators in private settings, steering clear of public feuds. The company was also forced into posting an apology after Sharma’s tweet in the wake of industrialist Ratan Tata’s passing last week was pilloried on social media.

A management consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that a professional manager overseeing a company would have been far more cautious in how they conduct themselves on public platforms.

In a nutshell, that is pretty much all they ask for. It doesn’t matter if the founder is running the company or a professional manager is. All they need is accountability,” said Agrawal of Anand Rathi. “Public markets want accountability and trust. In a nutshell, that is pretty much all they ask for.

Not all founders are able to transition to a professional CEO mindset but more importantly, not all companies need that approach,” Agrawal added. “A manager with more professional experience would typically be more controlled in his or her approach and the larger question is whether that’s what the company needs at that stage.

These leaders should challenge the founder's management decisions rather than simply admiring their every move.

So it is important to have some directors and senior management who have experience and expertise and whose decisions are valued by the founder,” he added. “The problem with today’s startups is that the founders have a superstar kind of an aura, so the board of directors today, or even the management, doesn’t question the founder too much,” Subramanian said. “Companies need to institutionalise processes and decision-making.
